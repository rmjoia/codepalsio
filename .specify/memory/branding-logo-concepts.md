```

---

### Concept 5: "Stylized "C" + Connection Node"
**Visual**: A stylized "C" (for CodePals or Connection) with a glowing node or connection point at its opening, suggesting open arms or a network hub

**Symbolism**:
- "C" = first letter of CodePals, accessibility
- Open arms = welcoming, inclusive
- Node/glow = connection, network, light/opportunity
- Simplicity = memorable, versatile

**Best For**: Simple, iconic, versatile across sizes and contexts  
**Risks**: Might feel too abstract without context

**Prompt Template**:
```
A modern, minimalist logo featuring a stylized capital letter "C" with clean curves. 
At the opening of the "C" is a glowing node or connection point (like a network hub or light). 
The node has subtle radiating lines suggesting connection or energy.

## MCP Integration (Optional but Recommended)

If you want to streamline logo generation, consider these MCPs:

### MCP 1: Image Generation MCP
**Purpose**: Direct image generation from prompts without leaving your development environment
**Models Supported**: DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, local models
**Installation**: 
```bash
# Example (check MCP registry for latest)
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-image-generation
```
**Benefit**: Generate and iterate on logos directly in VS Code or terminal

### MCP 2: Design System MCP
**Purpose**: Convert generated images to design specs (colors, typography, spacing)
**Benefit**: Auto-extract color codes, font recommendations from logo

### MCP 3: File Management MCP
**Purpose**: Organize generated logos, track versions, manage exports
**Benefit**: Keep branding assets organized with metadata

**Should I install MCPs?** Only if:
- ✅ You want to generate logos repeatedly without manual ChatGPT/DALL-E access
- ✅ You want to automate design system extraction
- ✅ Your development workflow stays in terminal/VS Code

**Skip MCPs if:**
- ✅ You prefer manual DALL-E/Midjourney exploration (often faster for first-time)
- ✅ You want human design iteration (not just prompts)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Generate Concepts**: Use DALL-E 3 with prompts above (5-10 mins)
2. **Evaluate Against Vision**: Does each concept convey "code penpals," connection, opportunity?
3. **Test Versatility**: 
   - Works at small sizes? (favicon, profile pic)
   - Works in monochrome? (print, inverse)
   - Works on colored backgrounds?
4. **Refinement**: Pick top 2-3, request variations (color, line weight, style)
5. **Finalization**: Selected concept → SVG export, transparent PNG, all formats
