### Data Model Overview

**Core Entities** (18 tables in Cosmos DB):

**User Management**:
- User (GitHub ID, username, avatar, approval status, role, Karma, badges)
- CodePals Profile (seeking, skills, bio, location, social links, age/parental consent status)
- ParentalConsent (guardian email, verification token, documents)

**Connections**:
- Connection (bidirectional: pending/accepted/declined/blocked)

**Community**:
- Event (title, description, date/time, Discord link, visibility)
- HelpBoardPost (author, type, title, skills, vote count, status)
- HelpBoardVote (user, post, Karma awarded)
- Karma (user total, history array)
- Badge, UserBadge (earned recognition)

**Analytics**:
- EventLog (signup, login, profile_edit, invite, vote, etc.)
- Report (user reports for CoC violations)
- AdminAuditLog (all admin actions: approve, reject, block, delete)

**i18n**:
- Locale (pt-PT, en-IE, fr-FR, es-ES configs)
- Translation (externalized strings per locale/namespace)
- UserLocalePreference (user's selected locale)

### i18n Architecture

**Translation File Structure**:
```
i18n/
├── en-IE/
│   ├── common.json      (generic UI strings: welcome, logout, etc.)
│   ├── profile.json     (profile form labels, seeking options, skills)
│   ├── errors.json      (validation messages, API errors)
│   ├── emails.json      (transactional email templates)
│   └── badges.json      (badge names, descriptions)
├── pt-PT/
├── fr-FR/
└── es-ES/
```

**Locale Detection**:
1. User's explicit preference (stored in UserLocalePreference)
2. Browser Accept-Language header (fallback)
3. Default: en-IE

**Coverage Requirement**: ≥95% core strings translated per supported locale (tracked in Locale.coverage_percentage)

## Cross-Phase Concerns

### Security & Privacy Throughout All Phases

**Secret Management**:
- All secrets (API keys, connection strings) stored in Azure Key Vault
- Never committed to Git
- Rotated every 90 days
- Audit log: Who accessed which secrets, when

**Input Validation**:
- All endpoints validate inputs (no HTML injection, sanitize text)
- Whitelist allowed characters per field
- File uploads: Max 5MB, whitelist image/PDF only
- Rate limiting: 100 req/min per IP on all endpoints

**Encryption**:
- Database: Sensitive fields encrypted at rest (social links, email, location, documents)
- In transit: All API calls over HTTPS
- Email: SendGrid uses TLS

**Access Control**:
- Role-based: admin vs user
- Profile details visible only to connected users (DB query filters)
- Admin audit log: Every admin action logged with timestamp, user, reason

**GDPR/Privacy**:
- User can delete account → marks user as "deleted" (data retained for 90 days, then purged)
- Location visibility toggle: Users control if location shown
- GitHub account deletion: Profile marked "orphaned", admin can preserve or deactivate

---

### Testing Strategy Throughout All Phases

**Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma)**:
- Target: ≥80% code coverage for all backend services
- Test framework setup: `npm run test` runs full suite with coverage report
- CI gate: PRs must have ≥80% coverage to merge
- Mock external services: SendGrid, Cosmos DB (use mocks in unit tests)

**Integration Testing**:
- Test API endpoints with realistic data flows
- Database: Use test Cosmos DB container (separate from production)
- Email: SendGrid sandbox mode (no actual emails sent)
- GitHub OAuth: Use test GitHub app credentials

**End-to-End Testing (Playwright)**:
- Critical user journeys:
  - Signup → profile creation → approval → approval email received
  - Browse → filter → click profile → connect → acceptance → message
  - Help board → create post → vote → verify Karma awarded
  - Admin: Approve profile → check audit log
  - Locale switching: en-IE → pt-PT → verify all strings translated
- Cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- CI: Run E2E tests on every PR (< 15 min execution)

**Performance Testing**:
- Load test: Simulate 100 concurrent users browsing profiles
- Target: <1sec response time for browse endpoint, <3sec for page loads
- Monitor: Database query times, API response times

**Accessibility Testing**:
- Automated: axe or pa11y on every page (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Manual: Screen reader (NVDA, JAWS) testing on critical paths
- Keyboard: Tab through all forms, verify focus indicators visible

---

### Internationalization (i18n) Throughout All Phases

**Translation Files**:
- Structure: `i18n/[locale]/[namespace].json`
- Namespaces: common, profile, errors, emails, badges, events, help_board
- Keys: Hierarchical (common.welcome, profile.bio_label, errors.required_field)
- Each locale: ≥95% coverage of core strings (tracked in Locale.coverage_percentage)

**Locale Detection**:
1. User's explicit preference (UserLocalePreference)
2. Browser Accept-Language header
3. Fallback: en-IE

**Email Localization**:
- SendGrid templates: Externalized per locale
- User's preferred locale: Email sent in their language
- Sender name: Can be localized (optional, "CodePals.io Support" or "Support CodePals.io")

**Date/Time Formatting**:
- pt-PT: DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time
- en-IE: DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time
- fr-FR: DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time
- es-ES: DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time

**RTL Support**:
- CSS structured for LTR/RTL: Use `dir="ltr"` or `dir="rtl"` on body
- Margin/padding: Use `margin-inline-start`, `margin-inline-end` (CSS Logical Properties)
- Text alignment: `text-align: start` (auto-flips with dir)

## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **GitHub OAuth goes down** | Users can't sign in | Fallback: Email auth with OTP (Phase 2+); cache OAuth tokens |
| **Cosmos DB free tier insufficient** | Scaling costs spike | Monitor RU usage; optimize queries; upgrade to paid at 400 RU/s threshold |
| **Low initial user adoption** | Platform feels empty | Launch with internal team, friends, early community; build events as engagement hook |
| **Parental consent workflow complex** | High friction for <18 users | Simplified UX: Email guardian, 1-click verification; optional document upload |
| **Translation coverage <95%** | i18n non-negotiable violated | Hire community translators; offer contribution pathway; start with en-IE + pt-PT, add fr-FR later |
| **Security incident (credentials leaked)** | Trust destroyed | Weekly secret rotation; no secrets in logs; incident response runbook; disclosure timeline (72h) |
| **Performance degradation** | Users abandon platform | Load testing in Phase 2; optimize queries; cache metrics; CDN for static assets |
| **Admin workload overwhelming** | You burned out | Auto-approval for low-risk profiles; bulk operations in Phase 2+; recruit moderators |
