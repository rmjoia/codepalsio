# CodePals.io Privacy Policy

Version: 0.1.0 (Draft) | Last Updated: 2025-11-16

## 1. Introduction
CodePals.io is a developer growth and mentorship network. We collect the minimal data necessary to enable connections, context‑rich help requests, and safe community interaction. We do **not** sell personal data.

## 2. Scope
This policy covers data processed through the CodePals.io platform (website/app), repositories, and integrated authentication (e.g., GitHub OAuth). Future scholarship program data will be governed by an extension of this policy before activation.

## 3. Data We Collect
| Category | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Account Identifiers (e.g., GitHub username) | Authentication, profile linking | OAuth only; no passwords stored |
| Profile Metadata (optional: bio, interests, technologies) | Matchmaking & mentorship discovery | User‑provided; editable or removable |
| Connection Graph (who you follow or mentor) | Enable personalized interactions | Stored as relationships, no public exposure of private links |
| Help Requests (content + context tag: work/school/self‑development) | Facilitate targeted assistance | Users instructed not to include confidential data |
| Activity Events (timestamps of posts, edits) | Abuse detection & rate limiting | Minimal operational metadata |
| Logs (non‑PII; request IDs, error traces) | Reliability & security monitoring | No sensitive payloads |
| Scholarship Application Data (future) | Case‑by‑case review | Collected only post program launch (separate policy addendum) |

We intentionally avoid collecting: precise location, unrelated demographic profiling, behavioral tracking across third‑party sites.

## 4. Legal Bases / Justification
- Legitimate interest: Operating a mentorship and growth platform.
- Consent: Optional profile fields, help request posting.
- Contract: Providing requested platform functionality.
(Refinements for jurisdictional compliance will be added—TBD.)

## 5. Data Minimization
All new data categories require justification and governance review. Any proposal must specify retention, security, and privacy risk.

## 6. Retention
| Data Category | Draft Retention | Status |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Account Identifiers | While account active | Confirm |
| Connection Graph | While account active or until removal | Confirm |
| Help Requests | Until user deletes or global archival (TBD max 2 years) | NEEDS DECISION |
| Logs | 30 days (operational) | Confirm |
| Scholarship Data (future) | Duration of evaluation + required reporting period (TBD) | NEEDS DECISION |

Retention decisions marked NEEDS DECISION will be finalized before production launch.

## 7. Security Practices
- No secrets in code or logs.
- Least privilege access to storage & keys.
- Dependency and secret scanning enforced.
- Potential future encryption-at-rest for sensitive scholarship data.

## 8. User Rights (Global Intent)
Users may request: access, correction, deletion of profile and help requests. Email privacy@codepals.io (placeholder) or use future in‑app controls. Data export functionality planned post MVP.

## 9. Cookies / Tracking
Currently limited to essential session management (if any). No cross‑site advertising or behavioral tracking. Any future analytics will be aggregated, anonymized, and documented.

## 10. Children
Platform not intended for users under 13. Accounts determined to violate this will be removed pending guardian contact procedure (to be documented).

## 11. Third‑Party Services
- GitHub OAuth: handles authentication; we store returned identifiers only.
- Cloud Hosting & Key Vault: credential storage; no direct user personal data beyond account IDs.

## 12. Data Disclosure
We do not voluntarily disclose personal data except:
- Legal compliance (narrowly scoped)
- Security investigations (minimal necessary data)
- Scholarship reporting (aggregate, anonymized) once program active.

## 13. Breach Notification
Material privacy incident will trigger public summary within 72h of containment (aligned with constitution governance metrics).

## 14. Changes to This Policy
Material updates follow amendment workflow; version and date will increment; prior versions archived.

## 15. Contact
privacy@codepals.io (placeholder) | security@codepals.io (placeholder) | conduct@codepals.io (placeholder)

## 16. Outstanding TODOs
- Finalize help request retention threshold.
- Define scholarship data fields & retention.
- Implement user self‑service export & deletion.

This is a draft and may evolve prior to production launch.
