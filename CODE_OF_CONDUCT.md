# CodePals.io Code of Conduct

Version: 1.0.0 | Last Updated: 2025-11-16

## Our Pledge
We pledge to foster a growth culture grounded in respect, mentorship, collaboration, transparency, security, privacy, and inclusivity. We commit to providing a harassment‑free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity/expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of positive behavior:
- Offering constructive, kind feedback and coaching guidance.
- Clearly labeling help requests (work, school, self‑development).
- Respecting privacy and never demanding disclosure of personal/confidential details.
- Acknowledging mistakes; focusing on resolution and learning.
- Using inclusive and accessible language.
- Promoting security best practices without shaming.

Unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory language.
- Doxxing or sharing personally identifying information without consent.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, mentoring sessions, or help channels.
- Encouraging unethical behavior (cheating on school/work assignments).
- Attempting to bypass security/privacy safeguards.

## Mentorship & Help Requests
Help requests MUST be tagged with context (work, school, self‑development). Mentors SHALL encourage learning and ethical use; direct completion of academic or paid tasks without learning intent is discouraged.

## Responsibilities
- **Maintainer** (interim): Oversees enforcement, transparency of actions.
- **Future Moderators**: Will assist once scale permits.

## Enforcement
Report violations via: conduct@codepals.io (placeholder; replace when active) or a private repository issue labeled `coc-report` (will be redacted). Emergency threats to safety: use local authorities then inform the project.

Reports will receive acknowledgment within 72 hours. Confidentiality respected to the extent legally possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction**: Minor, unintentional breach → reminder of standards.
2. **Warning**: Impactful breach → documented warning; expectations set.
3. **Temporary Suspension**: Repeated or severe breaches → time‑limited access removal.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Harassment, hate speech, security abuse, or repeated violations.

Transparency log (aggregate form, no personal details) will be published periodically.

## Scope
Applies to all project spaces (repository, discussions, mentorship channels, future website) and external platforms when representing CodePals.io.

## Appeals
Submit a concise appeal within 14 days of action. Reversal only if process error or new material context.

## Privacy Alignment
Behavior enforcement will minimize stored personal data. Only necessary metadata (timestamp, type, action) retained.

## Attribution
Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and expanded for mentorship and context tagging.

## Updates
Amendments follow the Constitution's workflow. Material changes announced via roadmap/release notes.
